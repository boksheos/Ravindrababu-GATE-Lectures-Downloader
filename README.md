# Lectures-Downloader
This script helps downloading videos from the site 'eclassesbyravindrababu.com'.
It uses python 3 and has dependencies to be easily resolved by the user. one of such dependency is selenium.

# Usage:
1. Install IDM.
1. The script needs your username and password.
1. The first two lines needs to be edited by the user and they need to assign uname, the username, and pword, the password.
1. Once, that's done, there are a few dependencies such as selenium, pyautogui, etc that needs to be resolved by the user.
1. After resolving the dependencies simply run the command below:
   ```
   $ python35 script.py
   ```
1. If you have connection issues, where internet might go offline due to varies issues like power failure or network issue you mat use the script ***run multiple times.py*** which will run the main script as and when the internet and other resources are present and resume after a failure in acquiring resources.

## Now, sit back and relax and watch the videos download on their own.
Avoid using the system  when it is working.

### Will be uploading a video on my [YOUTUBE CHANNEL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8Kpue_IKfiIJeLSzUo5UQ) soon, explaining usage details and how to get fix the commonly occuring errors.
